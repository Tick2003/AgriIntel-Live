**Headline:** 🚜 Revolutionizing Agriculture with AI: Introducing AgriIntel 🚀

I’m excited to share my latest project, **AgriIntel**, an advanced Market Intelligence Dashboard designed to tackle one of the biggest challenges in Indian agriculture: **Price Volatility**.

Farmers and traders often grapple with information asymmetry. AgriIntel bridges this gap by using a **Multi-Agent AI System** to provide real-time monitoring and actionable insights.

**🌟 Key Features:**
*   **🔮 Robust AI Forecasting:** Implements a sophisticated **Trend Decomposition + XGBoost Residual Modeling** strategy. It detrends market prices to capture long-term direction while using ML to predict short-term volatility 30 days out.
*   **⚡ Blazing Fast Performance:** Engineered for speed with intelligent **Data Caching**, ensuring instant analysis even with heavy ML computations running in the background.
*   **⚡ Shock Detection:** Automatically flags market anomalies and sudden price spikes (e.g., +15% shocks).
*   **🛡️ Risk Scoring:** A proprietary "Risk Engine" that calculates a 0-100 risk score based on volatility and forecast uncertainty.
*   **🤖 Agentic Architecture:** Built with specialized autonomous agents (Forecaster, Risk Manager, Data Health Monitor) working in harmony.

**🛠️ Tech Stack:**
*   **Python & Streamlit** for the interactive dashboard.
*   **XGBoost & Scikit-Learn** for machine learning.
*   **Plotly** for rich, responsive visualizations.
*   **SQLite** for robust local data management.
*   **Open-Meteo API** for real-time weather integration.

This project was a deep dive into building **Agentic Workflows** where each component acts independently to serve the user. It’s not just a dashboard; it’s a decision-support system.
